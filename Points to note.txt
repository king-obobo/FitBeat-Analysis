Points to note:
1. dailyActivity_merged tables contains data from 
    a. dailyCalories_merged
    b. dailyIntensities_merged
    c. dailySteps_merged
all merged to create the dailyActivity_merged table. Hence, these data would not be used for this analysis.

2. It is possible to drill down on the above columns using their hourly variants. 
    a. Drill down on the dailyCalories_merged (with calories column) via the hourlyCalories_merged table. 
    b. Drill down dailyintensities using the hourlyintensities table. 
    c. Drill down dailySteps (stepstotal) using the hourlySteps merged table.

3. I would be creating a new table (hourlyActivity_merged) by merging data from the hourly tables: hourlyCalories_merged, hourlyintensities, hourlySteps_merged

4. I will not be using these table as they are part of the dailyActivitymerged already: dailyCalories_merged, dailyIntensities_merged, dailySteps_merged.

5. I will also not be drilling further into these tables (all tables detailing minute activities) as I do not need the level of detail they offer. There are 5 tables fulfilling this condition namely: minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged, minuteCaloriesWide_merged, minuteIntensitiesWide_merged, minuteMETsNarrow_merged, minuteSleep_merged minuteStepsWide_merged and heartrate_seconds_merged.

5. Two table, sleepDay_merged and weightLogInfo_merged would be further explored.

EDA
- Doctors generally consider fewer than 5,000 steps per day to be sedentary
- Use average steps to calculate for the diff classes
< 7,499 is low
7,500 - 12,499 is active
12,500 and above is very active
